        </h1>
        <p>Fried duck eggs are similar to fried chicken eggs but tend to be richer and more flavorful due to the higher fat content and larger yolk size. Duck eggs have a creamier texture and a slightly stronger taste, which makes them popular in gourmet cooking. Here's a simple way to fry duck eggs:
            <br>
            Ingredients: 
            <br>
            - 1-2 duck eggs 
            <br>
            - 1-2 tbsp of oil or butter
            <br>
            - Salt and pepper (to taste)
            <br>
            
            Instructions:
            <br>
            1. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add oil or butter.
            <br>
            2. Crack the duck egg into a bowl, then gently pour it into the heated 
            <br>
            3. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolk reaches your preferred doneness.
            <br>
               - For sunny-side up: Cook without flipping.
               <br>
               - For over-easy or over-medium: Flip the egg gently and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
               <br>
            4. Season with salt and pepper, then serve.
            <br>
            
            Duck eggs can be enjoyed on their own, over toast, or as a complement to other dishes. Theyâ€™re also great in baking or making richer dishes like custards due to their creamy yolks.</p>
